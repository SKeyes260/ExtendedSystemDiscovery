This script works with SCCM 2012 to fix SCCM client records that have a missing DistinguishedName. All SCCM client records will a NULL value for DistinguishedName will be checked against a list of company domains using a specific DC for each domain. After all SCCM records have been identified the script will iterate through all of the AD data to find a matching computer name. If a match is found, an SCCM DDR file is created that contains the distinguished name and optionally the SMSGUID, MachineType and MachineCategory if they exist
